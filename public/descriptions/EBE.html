<p></strong><strong>Process Description:</strong> An electron beam evaporator is a physical vapor deposition system used to deposit high-purity thin films of metals and dielectric materials onto a substrate. Inside a high-vacuum chamber, a high-energy electron beam is generated and magnetically steered to strike a source material (e.g., gold, titanium, aluminum oxide) held in a crucible. The intense energy from the electron beam heats the material, causing it to sublimate or evaporate. This vapor then travels in a line-of-sight path and condenses on the cooler substrates mounted at the top of the chamber, forming a thin film. This technique is favored for its ability to deposit high-melting-point materials and create very pure films. The deposition rate and final film thickness are precisely monitored in real-time, often using a quartz crystal microbalance, allowing for exceptional control over the film&#x27;s properties.</p>

<p></strong><strong>System Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Deposition Chamber:</strong> The main high-vacuum chamber where the deposition process occurs. It houses the electron beam gun, crucible turret, substrate holder, and thickness monitor.</li>
  <li><strong>Observation Window:</strong> A shielded viewport that allows the operator to safely observe the electron beam hitting the source material as well as the sample and monitor the evaporation process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operation Procedure:</strong></p>

  <li>Vent the load-lock and carefully mount the substrate(s) onto the sample holder.</li>
  <li>Place the holder in the load-lock, close the door, and pump it down.</li>
  <li>Once at vacuum, transfer the sample holder into the main deposition chamber.</li>
  <li>Using the control software, select the desired source material and load the deposition recipe.</li>
  <li>Start the process, which involves ramping up the high voltage and electron beam current.</li>
  <li>Once the material is molten and the deposition rate is stable, a shutter opens, and the deposition on the substrate begins.</li>
  <li>Monitor the film thickness in real-time using the quartz crystal monitor.</li>
  <li>When the target thickness is reached, the shutter closes, and the beam power is ramped down.</li>
  <li>After a cool-down period, transfer the samples back to the load-lock, vent it, and retrieve your coated substrates.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Safety Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The electron gun operates at extremely high voltages (10kV or more) and generates intense, harmful X-rays during operation. The chamber is heavily shielded with lead. Never defeat any safety interlocks.</li>
  <li>Never attempt to open the main chamber door while it is under vacuum. Always use the load-lock.</li>
  <li>The crucible and source materials become extremely hot and can cause severe burns if handled improperly after a run.</li>
  <li>If the system uses a cryopump, be aware of procedures for handling liquid nitrogen or compressed helium.</li>
</ul>
