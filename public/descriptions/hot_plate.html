<p><strong>Process Description:</strong> A laboratory hot plate is a fundamental piece of equipment used to provide precise and uniform heating to samples. In a cleanroom or chemistry lab setting, its primary applications include soft-baking and hard-baking of photoresists, post-exposure baking, and evaporating solvents from substrates. The flat, heated surface ensures consistent thermal transfer, which is critical for achieving reproducible results in lithography and thin-film processing. Many models also include a magnetic stirring function for heating liquids in beakers. Digital controls on modern hot plates allow for the precise setting and monitoring of temperature to ensure process accuracy and repeatability.</p>
<p><strong>System Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Heating Surface:</strong> A flat top plate, made of ceramic or aluminum, that provides a uniform temperature distribution for the sample.</li>
  <li><strong>Temperature Controller:</strong> An electronic module with a digital display that allows the user to set and monitor the surface temperature. It uses feedback from an internal sensor to maintain the set point.</li>
  <li><strong>Control Knob/Buttons:</strong> Interface for setting the desired temperature and, if equipped, the magnetic stirring speed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operation Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure the hot plate is on a level, stable surface, and if using solvents, inside a certified fume hood.</li>
  <li>Turn on the power switch.</li>
  <li>Using the control knob or buttons, set the desired temperature for your process.</li>
  <li>Wait for the hot plate to reach and stabilize at the set temperature. The display will indicate when the actual temperature matches the set point.</li>
  <li>Using appropriate tweezers, carefully place your sample or wafer in the center of the heating surface.</li>
  <li>Time the baking/heating process according to your recipe.</li>
  <li>Once the time is complete, carefully remove the sample using tweezers and place it on a cooling rack.</li>
  <li>Turn the heat setting to zero or off and allow the hot plate to cool down completely before cleaning or storing.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Safety Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The surface can reach very high temperatures and remains hot long after being turned off. It can cause severe burns. Do not touch the surface.</li>
  <li>Always handle samples with heat-resistant tweezers.</li>
  <li>When heating any solvents or chemicals, the hot plate must be used inside a properly functioning chemical fume hood.</li>
  <li>Do not leave a hot plate unattended while it is in operation.</li>
  <li>Avoid placing cold glassware directly onto a very hot surface to prevent thermal shock and shattering.</li>
</ul>
