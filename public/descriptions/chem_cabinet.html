<p><strong>Process Description:</strong> A chemical cabinet is an essential piece of safety equipment for the secure storage of hazardous materials. These cabinets are engineered to protect the contents from fire, contain spills, and safely segregate incompatible chemicals to prevent dangerous reactions. As shown in the images, color-coded according to the hazard class they are designed to hold yellow for flammable liquids and blue for corrosive materials like acids and bases. Proper use and organization of these cabinets are critical for maintaining a safe laboratory environment. This systematic approach not only ensures compliance with safety regulations but also minimizes the risk of accidents, enhancing overall lab safety and efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>System Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Self-Latching Doors:</strong> Doors are designed to close and latch securely to ensure they remain shut during a fire.</li>
  <li><strong>Hazard Labels:</strong> Clear, large-format labels on the exterior (e.g., &quot;FLAMMABLE,&quot; &quot;ACID,&quot; &quot;CORROSIVE&quot;) to quickly identify the contents and associated hazards.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operation Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Identify the hazard class of the chemical you need to store by reading its label and Safety Data Sheet (SDS).</li>
  <li>Select the appropriate cabinet for that hazard class (e.g., place flammable solvents in the yellow cabinet).</li>
  <li>Ensure the chemical container is tightly sealed, properly labeled, and in good condition.</li>
  <li>Open the cabinet doors and place the container inside, ensuring it is stable and upright.</li>
  <li>Organize containers so that labels are visible and materials are accessible without reaching over other incompatible chemicals.</li>
  <li>Close the cabinet doors firmly, ensuring they have latched completely.</li>
  <li>Clean up any spills inside or outside the cabinet immediately with the appropriate procedure.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Safety Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Never store chemicals that can react dangerously with each other in the same cabinet (e.g., do not store acids and bases together, or flammables with oxidizers).</li>
  <li>Always keep cabinet doors closed and latched when not actively accessing them.</li>
  <li>Do not overload the cabinet beyond its specified capacity.</li>
  <li>Ensure the cabinet is properly grounded according to facility requirements, especially for flammable storage.</li>
  <li>Do not store paper or other combustible materials inside a chemical cabinet.</li>
</ul>
