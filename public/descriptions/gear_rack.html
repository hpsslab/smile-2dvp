<p><strong>Process Description:</strong> A cleanroom gear rack is a designated storage area for the personal protective equipment (PPE) and consumable supplies required for working in a cleanroom. Its purpose is to provide organized, convenient, and clean storage for items that personnel must use before and during their work inside the controlled environment. Proper management of this area is essential for maintaining the integrity of the cleanroom by ensuring that only approved, clean items are taken inside and that used or contaminated items are disposed of correctly. These racks are often constructed from non-shedding materials like stainless steel to prevent the generation of particles. This organization helps streamline the gowning protocol, minimizing the time personnel spend in the transition area and reducing the potential for contamination.</p>
<p><strong>System Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Storage Shelves:</strong> An open shelving unit used to organize various supplies.</li>
  <li><strong>Gloves:</strong> Boxes of nitrile or vinyl gloves that are worn to prevent contamination of samples from hands.</li>
  <li><strong>Consumable Supplies:</strong> Other necessary items such as cleanroom-grade wipes (e.g., Texwipes), swabs, notebooks, and pens.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operation Procedure (Gowning for Cleanroom Entry):</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Before approaching the rack, put on appropriate cleanroom garments.</li>
  <li>Select the correct size of cleanroom gloves. Put on the first layer of gloves, ensuring the cuffs go over the sleeves of the frock.</li>
  <li>Collect any other necessary supplies (wipes, notebooks) before proceeding past the gowning area into the main cleanroom.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Safety Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure all skin and hair is completely covered by the garments before entering the main lab.</li>
  <li>Do not bring personal items like paper notebooks, pencils, or standard pens into the cleanroom, as they generate particles. Use only approved cleanroom supplies.</li>
  <li>Keep the gear rack tidy and well-stocked. Report when supplies are running low.</li>
</ul>
