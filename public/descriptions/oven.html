<p><strong>Process Description:</strong> A laboratory oven is an insulated chamber used to provide a stable, high-temperature environment for various processes. In a cleanroom setting, its primary use is for the hard-baking of photoresists after development to improve their chemical and physical resistance for subsequent steps like etching. Other applications include curing polymers (like SU-8 or polyimide), dehydrating substrates to promote adhesion, and annealing materials. The forced air circulation within the oven ensures a uniform and stable temperature throughout the chamber. Its programmable controller allows for precise temperature ramping and dwelling profiles, which are essential for reproducible and optimized curing and annealing recipes.</p>

  <li><strong>Controller:</strong> The electronic interface with a digital display and keypad. It allows the user to program the setpoint temperature and a timer function for timed baking processes.</li>
  <li><strong>Door:</strong> An insulated door with a secure latch to maintain the internal temperature and prevent heat loss.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operation Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Turn on the main power switch for the oven.</li>
  <li>Using the controller, set the desired temperature for your process.</li>
  <li>If your process is timed, set the desired duration on the timer.</li>
  <li>Wait for the oven to preheat and stabilize at the setpoint temperature. The digital display will indicate the current internal temperature.</li>
  <li>Once stable, open the door and, using high-temperature-rated tweezers, carefully place your sample onto a shelf inside the chamber.</li>
  <li>Close the oven door securely. Start the timer if it doesn&#x27;t start automatically.</li>
  <li>After the bake is complete, turn off the oven or allow it to cool down.</li>
  <li>Using tweezers, carefully remove the hot sample and place it on a heat-resistant surface to cool.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Safety Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>All interior and exterior surfaces of the oven can become extremely hot and can cause severe burns.</li>
  <li>Always use appropriate high-temperature tweezers or tongs to handle samples and items inside the oven.</li>
  <li>Open the door slowly and stand to the side to avoid a blast of hot air.</li>
  <li>Only place materials in the oven that are rated for the set temperature. Do not place flammable solvents or low-melting-point plastics inside.</li>
  <li>Ensure the over-temperature protection is set to a reasonable value just above your process temperature.</li>
</ul>
