<p><strong>Process Description:</strong> Electron beam lithography (EBL) is a maskless lithography technique that uses a finely focused beam of electrons to draw custom patterns with sub-10 nm resolution. It is the premier method for creating the highest-resolution nanostructures for research, development, and prototyping. The Elionix system uses a high-brightness thermal field emission source to generate a stable, high-current electron beam. A complex set of electromagnetic lenses, apertures, and deflectors, all managed by the control rack, allows the beam to be precisely scanned across a substrate coated with an electron-sensitive resist, directly writing the pattern pixel by pixel. Electromagnetic lenses and deflectors precisely scan the beam across a substrate coated with an electron-sensitive resist, directly writing the pattern.</p>

  <li><strong>Stage &amp; Load-lock:</strong> The sample is placed on an ultra-high-precision laser interferometer stage capable of nanometer-scale movement. A robotic load-lock system allows for sample introduction and removal without breaking the high vacuum of the main electron optics chamber.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operation Procedure:</strong></p>

AI-generated content may be incorrect." loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="display: block ; width: 100% ; height: auto ; aspect-ratio: 154 / 115" /></figure>Log in to the control PC and launch the EBL control software.</li>
  <li>Verify system status, ensuring the main column and gun are at high vacuum.</li>
  <li>Vent the load-lock chamber.</li>
  <li>Carefully mount the resist-coated sample onto a sample holder and place it into the load-lock.</li>
  <li>Pump down the load-lock. Once at vacuum, transfer the sample into the main chamber.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the desired location on the sample using the stage controls.</li>
  <li>Perform system calibrations, including beam focus, stigmation, and aperture alignment.</li>
  <li>Load the pattern design file (e.g., GDSII format) and set exposure parameters (e.g., dose, beam current, step size).</li>
  <li>Run the exposure recipe to write the pattern.</li>
  <li>After the writing is complete, transfer the sample back to the load-lock, vent, and retrieve your sample for development.</li>
  <li>Return the main chamber to an idle, high-vacuum state.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Safety Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>High voltage (many kilovolts) is present in the system during operation. Never attempt to bypass safety interlocks.</li>
  <li>The system is shielded for X-ray radiation, which is generated when the high-energy electron beam strikes the sample.</li>
  <li>Always leave the main chamber in a high-vacuum state to protect the electron gun and optics.</li>
  <li>Push the emergency stop button in case of any abnormal system behavior or emergency.</li>
</ul>
