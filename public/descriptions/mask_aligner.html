<p><strong>Process Description:</strong> A mask aligner is a precision optical instrument used for photolithography, the process of transferring a micropattern from a photomask to a photoresist-coated substrate. The system aligns the mask, which contains the desired pattern, with the substrate. Once aligned, a high-intensity UV light source illuminates the mask, projecting the pattern onto the photoresist. This exposure changes the chemical properties of the resist, allowing the pattern to be developed in a subsequent step. Mask aligners are fundamental tools for microfabrication, enabling the creation of microelectronic devices, MEMS, and microfluidic systems.</p>
<p><strong>System Components:</strong></p>

The red box on top likely houses this lamp.</li>
  <li><strong>Mask Holder:</strong> A frame that securely holds the photomask in a fixed position above the substrate.</li>
  <li><strong>Substrate Chuck:</strong> A vacuum chuck that holds the substrate or wafer. This chuck is mounted on a high-precision alignment stage.</li>
  <li><strong>Alignment Stage:</strong> A set of micrometers and joysticks that allow for precise X, Y, Z, and theta (rotation) movement of the substrate relative to the mask, enabling accurate alignment.</li>
  <li><strong>Controller:</strong> The electronic interface used to set the exposure time, control the vacuum to the chucks, and manage the contact between the mask and substrate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operation Procedure:</strong></p>

  <li>Secure the photomask into the mask holder.</li>
  <li>Place the photoresist-coated substrate onto the substrate chuck and engage the vacuum.</li>
  <li>Move the substrate stage under the mask.</li>
  <li>Using the microscope and the alignment stage micrometers, carefully align the features on the substrate to the features on the mask.</li>
  <li>Once aligned, bring the substrate into contact (or close proximity) with the mask, according to the process requirements (e.g., hard contact, soft contact).</li>
  <li>Set the desired exposure time on the controller.</li>
  <li>Start the exposure. The UV lamp shutter will open for the specified time, exposing the resist.</li>
  <li>After exposure, separate the substrate from the mask and lower the stage.</li>
  <li>Disengage the substrate vacuum and carefully remove the exposed sample with tweezers for development.</li>
  <li>Turn off the UV lamp and main power when finished.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Safety Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Never look directly at the UV lamp. It can cause severe and permanent eye damage. Always ensure all shielding is in place during operation.</li>
  <li>The lamp power supply uses high voltage. Do not attempt to open the lamp housing.</li>
  <li>Be mindful of moving parts, especially the microscope and stage assembly, to avoid pinching fingers.</li>
  <li>The lamp housing becomes very hot during operation; do not touch it.</li>
</ul>
