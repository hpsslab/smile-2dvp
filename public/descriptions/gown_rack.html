<p><strong>Process Description:</strong> A cleanroom gown rack is a storage system located in the gowning area, which serves as the antechamber to a cleanroom. Its purpose is to hold a supply of clean, individually packaged cleanroom garments. As seen in the image, the garments are organized by type and size in labeled bins or bags to allow for an efficient and orderly gowning process. Gown rack is essential to prevent contamination and to ensure that every user entering the cleanroom wears a fresh, particle-free set of garments. Therefore, it is a critical element that ensures the cleanliness and yield of the processes performed inside.</p>
<p><strong>System Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Wire Shelving:</strong> Open wire shelving is used to promote laminar airflow and minimize the collection of dust and particles.</li>
  <li><strong>Packaged Garments:</strong> Individually bagged and sealed cleanroom garments, which may include coveralls (&quot;bunny suits&quot;), frocks, hoods, and shoe covers.</li>
  <li><strong>Size Labels:</strong> Labels on the bags or shelves indicating the size of the garments (e.g., S, M, L, XL) to allow users to quickly find the correct fit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operation Procedure (The Gowning Process):</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Approach the rack after completing the initial gowning steps (e.g., putting on shoe covers).</li>
  <li>Select the appropriate bag containing a cleanroom garment of your correct size.</li>
  <li>Carefully open the package without letting the garment touch the floor or non-cleanroom surfaces.</li>
  <li>Step into the coverall or put on the frock, gathering the legs and sleeves to prevent them from dragging on the floor.</li>
  <li>Proceed to the next gowning steps, such as putting on a hood, face mask, safety glasses, and gloves, retrieving these from their designated storage locations.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Safety Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Never use a garment that has been dropped on the floor or is from a package that is already open. Discard it and get a new one.</li>
  <li>Ensure a proper fit. Garments that are too large can be a safety hazard, while those that are too small may tear or not provide adequate coverage.</li>
  <li>Do not bring the external packaging of the garments into the main cleanroom area; dispose of it in the gowning room.</li>
  <li>Keep the gowning area and the rack clean and organized. Report if the stock of any size is running low.</li>
</ul>
