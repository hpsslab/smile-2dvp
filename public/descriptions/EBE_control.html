<p><strong>Process Description:</strong> The control rack is the centralized command center and &quot;brain&quot; of the electron beam evaporator system. It integrates the computer, software, power supplies, and controllers necessary to manage the entire deposition process with high precision. From this console, the user operates the high-vacuum system, controls the high-voltage electron gun, selects the source material, and executes automated recipes to deposit films of a specific thickness and rate. The rack provides real-time feedback on critical parameters such as chamber pressure, deposition rate, and accumulated film thickness, often monitored by a quartz crystal microbalance. This continuous monitoring allows the user to make precise adjustments or for the system to automatically regulate the process to achieve the desired outcome. Its interlocking safety features are also managed here, ensuring that high-voltage and vacuum systems operate only under safe conditions.</p>

  <li><strong>Keyboard/Mouse:</strong> A retractable tray holding standard input devices for interacting with the software and entering recipe parameters.</li>
  <li><strong>Status Indicator Light:</strong> A tower light on top of the rack provides an immediate visual status of the machine (e.g., green for running, yellow for warning, red for alarm), visible from across the lab.</li>

<p><strong>Operation Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Log in to the control computer to launch the main deposition software.</li>
  <li>Use the software interface on the monitor to check the system status, ensuring vacuum levels are normal and all components are idle.</li>
  <li>Load a pre-existing recipe or create a new one by defining the material, target thickness, deposition rate, and other process parameters.</li>
  <li>Initiate the automated sequence for loading the sample from the load-lock into the main chamber.</li>
  <li>Start the deposition recipe. The user then monitors the process on the screen, watching the system automatically ramp up the e-gun power and control the deposition via feedback from the thickness monitor.</li>
  <li>The system will automatically complete the deposition and cool-down sequence.</li>
  <li>Use the software to run the automated sequence to retrieve the sample from the main chamber.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Safety Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>This rack controls a system that generates lethal high voltages and harmful X-ray radiation. Never attempt to override any software safety interlocks or alarms.</li>
  <li>Pay immediate attention to any alarm indicators on the status light tower or error messages on the monitor.</li>
  <li>Do not block the ventilation fans on the rack, as proper cooling is critical for the high-power electronics inside.</li>
</ul>
