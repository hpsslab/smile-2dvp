<p><strong>Process Description:</strong> A chemical fume hood is a critical piece of safety equipment that functions as a ventilated enclosure. It protects the user from inhaling hazardous or toxic fumes, vapors, and dusts generated during chemical procedures. It works by drawing a continuous stream of air from the laboratory, into the hood, and exhausting it safely out of the building. This constant airflow creates a barrier that prevents contaminants from escaping into the user&#x27;s breathing zone, making it essential for any work involving volatile solvents, acids, bases, and other hazardous materials. The adjustable front sash must be kept at the lowest practical height to serve as a physical shield and maintain proper airflow for maximum containment and safety.</p>
<p><strong>System Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sash:</strong> The movable front window of the fume hood. It acts as a physical barrier, and its position controls the airflow. For maximum safety, it should be kept as low as possible during experiments.</li>
  <li><strong>Work Surface:</strong> The main benchtop area inside the hood where chemical apparatus and experiments are placed. It is made from a chemically resistant material.</li>
  <li><strong>Exhaust System:</strong> A dedicated fan, located on the roof of the building, that actively pulls air from the hood through a network of ducts.</li>
  <li><strong>Airflow Monitor:</strong> A safety device that continuously measures the face velocity (the speed of air entering the hood) and will alarm if the flow drops to an unsafe level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operation Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Turn on the fume hood light and verify that the exhaust system is operational. Check the airflow monitor to ensure it reads &quot;Normal&quot; or indicates a safe flow rate.</li>
  <li>Raise the sash to a comfortable working height, but never above the indicated maximum safe level. Keep the sash as low as possible at all times.</li>
  <li>Place all chemicals and equipment at least 6 inches (15 cm) back from the plane of the sash to ensure proper containment.</li>
  <li>Perform your chemical work.</li>
  <li>Once the procedure is complete and all containers are sealed, close the sash completely.</li>
  <li>Clean the work surface of any spills according to proper lab procedure.</li>
  <li>Keep the sash closed when the hood is not in active use to conserve energy and ensure lab safety.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Safety Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Always verify the fume hood is operational before starting work. If the alarm sounds, stop work and contact facility personnel.</li>
  <li>Never put your head inside the fume hood.</li>
  <li>Keep the sash as low as possible. Use the sash as a safety shield.</li>
  <li>Do not store large pieces of equipment or excessive amounts of chemicals inside the hood, as this can disrupt airflow.</li>
  <li>In case of a fire or uncontrolled reaction inside the hood, lower the sash completely and contact emergency personnel.</li>
</ul>
