<p><strong>Process Description:</strong> A dry etching tool removes material from a substrate through the use of gaseous plasma instead of liquid chemicals. This specific tool appears to be an Inductively Coupled Plasma Reactive Ion Etcher (ICP-RIE), an advanced system used for creating high-aspect-ratio micro and nanostructures with anisotropic profiles. The process involves introducing reactive gases into a vacuum chamber, which are then ionized by RF (radio frequency) power to create a plasma. A separate RF bias applied to the substrate holder accelerates these reactive ions toward the sample, resulting in a combination of chemical reaction and physical sputtering that precisely removes unmasked material. This method offers superior control over etch directionality and feature size compared to wet etching, making it indispensable for modern semiconductor and MEMS fabrication.</p>

This increases throughput and minimizes contamination.</li>
  <li><strong>Etching Chamber:</strong> The main high-vacuum process chamber where the plasma is generated and the etching takes place. It contains the substrate holder (platen) and the gas inlets.</li>
  <li><strong>Gas Delivery System:</strong> A network of mass flow controllers (MFCs) that precisely mix and deliver reactive and inert gases (e.g., SF₆, O₂, Ar, CHF₃) into the etching chamber.</li>
  <li><strong>RF Generators &amp; Vacuum Pumps:</strong> The underlying equipment (not fully visible) that provides the RF power to generate and sustain the plasma and the turbo/roughing pumps required to maintain the high-vacuum environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operation Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Log in to the control PC and verify the system status is idle and under vacuum.</li>
  <li>Vent the loadlock chamber.</li>
  <li>Once vented, place the sample onto the transfer arm or tray inside the loadlock and close the lid.</li>
  <li>Pump down the loadlock.</li>
  <li>When the loadlock has reached the target vacuum, transfer the sample into the main etching chamber.</li>
  <li>On the computer, select or create the desired etching recipe, specifying gases, flow rates, chamber pressure, ICP power, bias power, and etch time.</li>
  <li>Run the recipe. The system will automatically execute the programmed steps to etch your sample.</li>
  <li>After the process is complete, transfer the sample back to the loadlock.</li>
  <li>Vent the loadlock and carefully remove your etched sample with tweezers.</li>
  <li>Pump down the loadlock to return the system to its idle state.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Safety Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Many process gases used in dry etching are toxic, corrosive, or flammable. Never attempt to bypass safety interlocks on the gas lines.</li>
  <li>The system uses high-power radio frequency (RF) energy and high voltages. Ensure all shielding is in place.</li>
  <li>Never open the process chamber to atmosphere; always use the loadlock.</li>
  <li>The plasma generates intense UV light. Do not look directly at the plasma through a viewport without proper eye protection.</li>
  <li>Be aware of automated moving parts, such as the loadlock and internal transfer mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
