<p><strong>Process Description:</strong> An ultrasonic bath, also known as a sonicator, is a device used for cleaning delicate parts, substrates, and glassware with high precision. It works by using high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) transmitted through a liquid medium. These sound waves create millions of microscopic cavitation bubbles that form and violently collapse. This process, called cavitation, generates a powerful scrubbing action that can remove sub-micron contaminants from surfaces without the need for harsh chemicals or manual brushing. Common applications include cleaning wafers, dissolving powders, and degassing solvents.</p>

<p><strong>System Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tank:</strong> The main stainless-steel reservoir that holds the cleaning liquid (e.g., deionized water, solvents).</li>
  <li><strong>Control Panel:</strong> The digital display interface used to set the sonication time and, on some models, the bath temperature.</li>
  <li><strong>Lid:</strong> A cover for the tank that reduces noise, minimizes evaporation of the liquid, and helps maintain a stable temperature.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operation Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol>

  <li>Fill the tank with the appropriate liquid (e.g., DI water) to the indicated fill line.</li>
  <li>If a fresh liquid is used, sonicate for 5-10 minutes to remove dissolved gases, which improves cleaning efficiency.</li>
  <li>Place the items to be cleaned into a suitable beaker with a cleaning solvent, or into a mesh basket. Do not place items directly on the bottom of the tank.</li>
  <li>Suspend the beaker or basket in the bath, ensuring the liquid level inside is similar to the bath level.</li>
  <li>Set the desired cleaning time using the control panel.</li>
  <li>Press the &#x27;Start&#x27; button to begin sonication.</li>
  <li>Once the cycle is complete, carefully remove the basket or beaker.</li>
  <li>Turn off the unit. Drain and clean the tank as required by lab procedures.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Safety Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Do not place your hands or any body parts into the bath while it is operating. The cavitation process can damage tissue.</li>
  <li>If using flammable or volatile solvents (like acetone or IPA), they must be contained within a beaker. Never fill the main tank directly with a flammable solvent.</li>
  <li>Ensure the ultrasonic bath is used in a well-ventilated area or a fume hood when working with volatile chemicals.</li>
  <li>Never run the ultrasonic bath dry (without liquid), as this will permanently damage the transducers.</li>
  <li>The unit generates a high-frequency noise during operation; hearing protection may be considered for prolonged use.</li>
</ul>
