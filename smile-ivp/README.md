# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Prompt used
I want to create a web based interactive video player application, named SMILE-ivp. This application should have the following features:
- This is an interactive streaming video player.  It will play a video list in M3U format. Each item in that list is an http url pointing to an mp4 file in a remote server.
- When the video is playing, it will allow users to click on regions of interest (ROIs) in a given frame.
- When the user clicks on a ROI, the video playback will stop and an overlay window will popup. The window will have semi transparent background and it will display an html page inside the popup window.  The window will be scrollable and it will have a close button.
- The ROIs will be provided separately in a file with a .roi extension. The name of this file will be same with the mp4 video file specified in the m3u playlist.
- The ROI file will be formatted as a json file. The json file format will be as follows: 
{
  "frames": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "objects": [
        {
          "object-id": "12345",
          "annotation": "ALD device",
          "geometry": {
            "x": 150,
            "y": 100,
            "width": 250,
            "height": 250
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

- The ROI JSON file contains an array of frame-range items.
- Each frame-range item contains a start-time and end-time property in seconds.. Frame-range item also contains an array of objects, each of which defines a rectangle (x,y, width and height) to be drawn for the given range of frame durations in the video.
- As the video played, each object in the ROI file that corresponds to the current timestamp  will be highlighted with a rectangle overlay on the video. Also the the string value of  the "annotation" property of the object will be displayed on top of the rectangle overlay.
- Please use react to implement the project. 


## Commands
sudo apt install npm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" && [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" && nvm install 18
npx create-react-app smile-ivp --template typescript
cd smile-ivp && npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled react-player
cd smile-ivp && npm install @mui/icons-material

npm start

## result

I've created a complete React application for the SMILE-ivp (Interactive Video Player) with the following features:
Video Player Component:
Uses ReactPlayer for video playback
Supports M3U playlist format
Displays ROI overlays on the video
Shows annotations for each ROI
Handles ROI click events
Popup Dialog Component:
Semi-transparent background with blur effect
Scrollable content area
Close button
Displays HTML content for clicked ROIs
Main App Component:
Dark theme using Material-UI
Loads M3U playlist and corresponding ROI files
Manages state for video playback and popup dialog
Handles ROI click events and displays content
Type Definitions:
Complete TypeScript interfaces for ROI data structure
Type-safe component props
To use the application:
Place your M3U playlist file in the public directory as playlist.m3u
Place your ROI JSON files in the public directory with the same name as the video file but with .roi extension
Update the video URLs in the playlist to point to your actual video files
Run the development server with npm start
The application will:
Load the first video from the playlist
Load the corresponding ROI file
Display ROI overlays on the video as it plays
Show popup dialogs with HTML content when ROIs are clicked
Note: The current implementation includes placeholder HTML content for the popup dialogs. In a real application, you would need to:
Set up a server to serve the actual video files
Implement proper CORS handling for video and ROI file access
Set up a server to serve the HTML content for each ROI
Add error handling for missing or invalid files
Add loading states and error message
