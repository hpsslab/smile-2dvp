<p></strong><strong>Optical Microscope</strong></p>
<p><strong>Process Description:</strong> A high-magnification optical microscope used for visually examining substrates, wafers, and devices at various stages of the microfabrication process. Its primary purpose is quality control. It is used to inspect the fidelity of photolithography patterns, check for defects after etching or deposition steps, verify alignment, and identify surface contamination or damage. With a range of objectives, it allows for both low-magnification overviews and high-resolution inspection of micron-scale features. Many are equipped with a digital camera and software for capturing images, which is essential for documentation, measurement, and detailed analysis.</p>
<p><strong>System Components:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Eyepieces:</strong> The dual oculars through which the user views the magnified image.</li>
  <li><strong>Objective Turret (Revolving Nosepiece):</strong> A rotating mount that holds multiple objective lenses with different magnification powers (e.g., 5x, 10x, 50x, 100x).</li>
  <li><strong>Stage:</strong> A flat platform with clips or a vacuum chuck where the wafer or sample is placed. It can be moved precisely in the X and Y directions to navigate across the sample.</li>
  <li><strong>Illuminator:</strong> The light source (a halogen or LED lamp) that provides bright-field illumination. Light is directed through the objective lens onto the sample (reflected light microscopy), which is ideal for opaque substrates like silicon wafers.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus Knobs:</strong> Coarse and fine adjustment knobs that move the stage or objective lens up and down to bring the image into sharp focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operation Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Turn on the illuminator and set it to a medium brightness.</li>
  <li>Carefully place your wafer or sample onto the center of the stage.</li>
  <li>Rotate the objective turret to select the lowest magnification objective lens (e.g., 5x).</li>
  <li>Looking through the eyepieces, use the coarse focus knob to bring the surface of the sample into approximate focus.</li>
  <li>Use the fine focus knob to achieve a sharp image.</li>
  <li>Move the X-Y stage controls to navigate to the area of interest on your sample.</li>
  <li>Once the desired area is found, rotate the turret to a higher magnification objective.</li>
  <li>Refocus the image using only the fine focus knob.</li>
  <li>Adjust the illumination and aperture settings to optimize image brightness and contrast.</li>
  <li>When finished, switch back to the lowest magnification objective, lower the stage, and carefully remove your sample.</li>
  <li>Turn off the illuminator to preserve the lamp life.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Safety Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Always handle wafers and samples with appropriate tweezers to avoid contamination and scratches.</li>
  <li>Never touch the optical surfaces of the objective lenses or eyepieces with your fingers.</li>
  <li>When switching to high-magnification objectives, be careful not to crash the lens into the surface of the sample. Always focus by moving the lens away from the sample.</li>
  <li>Be gentle with the focus and stage movement controls.</li>
</ul>
