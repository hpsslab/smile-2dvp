<p><strong>Process Description:</strong> An emergency safety shower and eyewash station is a critical first-aid device designed for immediate decontamination of a person who has been exposed to hazardous chemicals. In the event of a large chemical splash or spill onto a person&#x27;s body or clothing, the drench shower provides a high volume of water to rapidly rinse away contaminants. The integrated eyewash station is used for flushing hazardous materials specifically from the eyes and face. These units are a mandatory safety fixture in any laboratory where hazardous chemicals are handled. Activation is designed for simple, hands-free operation, typically via a large pull handle for the shower and a push paddle for the eyewash. For effective decontamination, the standard protocol requires the affected person to remain under the continuous water flow for a full 15 minutes. To ensure immediate access during an emergency, these stations are always located in clearly marked, unobstructed areas within a 10-second walk from potential hazards.</p>
